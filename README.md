# An Archaeology Stop Motion Movie Festival!

## April 5 - 30th, with winners revealed May 4th.

Let's have a movie festival. Also, I like stop-motion films - y'know, like the [Wallace and Gromit](https://www.wallaceandgromit.com/) films. So here's what you do -

## How?

1. Make a stop motion film on one of the following themes:
  - a. archaeological theory
  - b. history of archaeology
  - c. the story of a site
  - d. the story of a dig
  - e. the biography of an object
2. Make it **two minutes** in length
3. Can be lego, clay, paper cut outs, whatever you like
4. Upload to youtube
5. Tweet it out with `#archstopmo`
6. Check out [twitter under the 'archstopmo' hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=archstopmo)
7. Prepare an artist's statement that explains and contextualizes your work, as well as the software you've used, and your process.
8. Submit your film at the form below.
9. Have fun!

## Film Gallery

There will be a [film gallery](film-gallery.md) on this site, which will be updated frequently with entries and links to the artist's statement.

## Judging

Prizes (there are no prizes, only glory!) will be selected by a panel of judges, plus one audience choice.

  - Best in each category - five prizes
  - Choix des Judges - best overall
  - Choix du Peuple - best by voting
